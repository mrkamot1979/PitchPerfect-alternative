Udacity's Pitch Perfect 
=======

Overview
-----------
This app is part of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree program.  You can actually learn without paying for it as the video is free.  The nanodegree understandably has other advantages.

Installation on iPhone
-----------
I tried to install on my iphone but it kept crashing but did find this [page] (https://discussions.udacity.com/t/pitchperfect-app-crashing-on-iphone/274881).  Essentially when you install on the iPhone, you just need to ask permission from the User that you will be using the phone's microphone.
